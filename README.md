# Perlin
Perlin is a Python game using procedural generation for creating a 2D map, that is to say, every time a new game is started then a new map will be generated, villages, roads, and NPCs will be not at the same place either.

## Goal
The goal of the game is to find a way to get out of the central island and explore the islands around.

## How to play the game
Download the good version of the game in the GitHub dist directory according to your OS. Then use ZQSD to move around the map. You're not French huh, well you can change controls in settings.

# A little more about the game

## Algorithms
We used Perlin noise to generate the map and A* to draw the roads between villages.
